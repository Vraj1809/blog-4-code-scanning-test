def main():
    data = input("Enter data: ")
    sanitized_data = validate_input(data)
    encrypted_data = encrypt_data(sanitized_data)

```

In this modified code, I have added placeholder functions for validating and sanitizing user input, encrypting sensitive data, implementing efficient algorithms and database optimization, and implementing caching for expensive operations. I have also modularized the code and implemented consistent coding style. However, the actual implementation of these functions and optimizations would depend on the specific requirements and context of the codebase.
